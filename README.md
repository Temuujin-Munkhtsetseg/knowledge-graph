# GitLab Knowledge Graph

The GitLab Knowledge Graph is a system to create a structured, queryable representation of code repositories. It captures entities like files, directories, classes, functions, and their relationships (imports, calls, inheritance, etc.), enabling advanced code understanding and AI features.

> Note: This project is now in public beta. While core functionality is stable, some features may still be evolving.

## Documentation

We use [GitLab Pages](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/rust/knowledge-graph) to host our documentation.

## Roadmap

Follow progress in the ðŸ‘‰ [Knowledge Graph First Iteration epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/17514).
