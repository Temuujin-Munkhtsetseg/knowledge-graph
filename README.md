# GitLab Knowledge Graph

The GitLab Knowledge Graph is a system to create a structured, queryable representation of code repositories. It captures entities like files, directories, classes, functions, and their relationships (imports, calls, inheritance, etc.), enabling advanced code understanding and AI features.

> Note: This project is not production ready and is still under active development.

## Roadmap

libraries which are large, it uses LFS to store them. Make sure you have [git
lfs](https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/git/lfs/) installed.
