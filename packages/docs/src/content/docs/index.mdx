## Get Started in Minutes

<Steps>

1. **Install GitLab Knowledge Graph**

   One-line installation:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/rust/knowledge-graph/-/raw/main/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Index your first repository**

   Navigate to your project and create the knowledge graph:

   ```bash
   gkg index
   ```

3. **Explore with the web interface**

   Start the server and open your browser:

   ```bash
   gkg server start
   ```

</Steps>
