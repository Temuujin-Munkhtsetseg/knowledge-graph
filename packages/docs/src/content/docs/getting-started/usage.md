This guide will help you get GitLab Knowledge Graph up and running on your first project in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

- GitLab Knowledge Graph [installed](../install)
- A workspace folder with an initialized Git repository

## Basic Indexing

The simplest way to start is by indexing a single repository or workspace folder.

### Index Current Directory

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
gkg index
```

This will:

1. Discover all Git repositories in the current directory
2. Parse and analyze the code structure
3. Store the results in a local graph database
4. Display progress and completion statistics

### Index a Specific Directory

You can also specify a path to index:

```bash
gkg index /path/to/your/workspace
```

### Example Output

```bash
$ gkg index my-project
âœ… Workspace indexing completed in 12.34 seconds

Workspace Statistics:
- Projects indexed: 3
- Files processed: 1,247
- Code entities extracted: 5,832
- Relationships found: 12,156
```

## Server Mode

For more advanced usage, you can start GitLab Knowledge Graph in server mode:

### Start the Server

```bash
gkg server start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:27495` by default. You will see output like this:

```bash
INFO http_server: HTTP server listening on 127.0.0.1:27495
```

### Access the Web Interface

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:27495` to access the GitLab Knowledge Graph web interface. From here you can:

- View indexed workspaces and projects
- Browse the knowledge graph visually
- Search for code entities and relationships
- Monitor indexing progress in real-time

For more information on the server, see the [gkg server](/cli/server) command.

## IDE integration

GitLab Knowledge Graph integrates with your IDE. See [IDE Integration](../ide-integration) for details.
